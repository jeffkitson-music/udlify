A simple tool to quickly convert text to title text. 

## :dizzy: About
This is a simple GUI implementation of the string.title() attribute in Python. Type or paste text in the text box, recieve title text back. 

## :books: Background
I am a teacher. In order to make education more accessible, course webpages need to be follow certain guidelines. Some materials I got from a publisher included lots of label text that was in ALL CAPS. According to our guidelines, this is not allowed. Rather than retype all that text for each label, Python can help! This will speed up the process tremendously. 

## :eyes: Disclaimer
This is a hobby project for personal use to meet school requirements. Always follow current best practice to make education accessible to everyone.
